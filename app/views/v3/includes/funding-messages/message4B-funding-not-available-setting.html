  <!-- Early years + not NPQEYL -->
  <p>Youâ€™re not eligible for scholarship funding for the {{ data['choosenpq'] }} course as you do not work in one of the eligible settings, such as state-funded schools.</p>
  <p>This means that you would need to pay for the course another way. For example, you could pay for the course fees yourself or ask your workplace or trust to:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>cover the full cost of the course</li>
    <li>share the cost of the course with you</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, you may be eligible for scholarship funding for the early years leadership NPQ.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">You can <a href="../choose-npq">go back and select the early years leadership NPQ</a> instead to check if you're eligible.</p>
