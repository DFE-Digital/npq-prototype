  <p>Youâ€™re not eligible for scholarship funding for the {{ data['choosenpq'] }} course as your workplace is not in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-for-national-professional-qualifications-npqs#scholarship-funding-for-autumn-2024">list of settings that are eligible for funding</a>.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">This means that you would need to pay for the course another way.</p>
  <p>For example, you could pay for the course fees yourself or ask your workplace or trust to:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>cover the full cost of the course</li>
    <li>share the cost of the course with you</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- chosen Maths, SENCO, EHCO, Headship -->
  <p>However, you may be eligible for scholarship funding for one of the following courses:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>headship</li>
    <li>special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO)</li>
    <li>early headship coaching offer</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">You can <a href="../choose-npq">go back and select one of these courses</a> instead to check if you're eligible.</p>
