        Early headship coaching offer
      </h1>


      <p>
        This targeted one-year support package has been tailored to the needs of new headteachers.
      </p>
      <p>
        It provides structured, unassessed face-to-face support based on the best available evidence about what makes an effective headteacher.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can complete it alongside the national professional qualification for headship (NPQH). You can also do it if you have recently taken the NPQH.
      </p>
      <p>
        The support you recieve will differ depending on your chosen provider. It may include group coaching, one-to-one support and peer networking.
      </p>
