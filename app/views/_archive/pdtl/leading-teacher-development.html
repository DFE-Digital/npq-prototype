      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="benefits">How you and your school could benefit</h2>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Professional development culture</h3>
      <p>
        Build expertise around creating a culture of professional learning and continuous improvement in your school. Staff feel supported if their school invests in their development. This can then filter down to the classroom, resulting in happier, more motivated pupils.
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Pupil outcome improvements</h3>
      <p>
        You’ll learn how to ensure professional development in your school is focused on a shared responsibility for improving outcomes for all pupils.
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Effective support for colleagues</h3>
      <p>
        Develop the skills to help colleagues plan effective lessons, meet individual pupil needs and provide opportunities for all pupils to succeed without creating unnecessary workload.
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Training based around individual timetables</h3>
      <p>
        You can complete much of the work in bite-size chunks around existing schedules.
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Learn with people from different education settings</h3>
      <p>
        Take advantage of training alongside a diverse group of fellow educators with lots of different perspectives. You can learn from each other’s experiences and bounce ideas off each other during group sessions and collaborative practical tasks.
      </p>
